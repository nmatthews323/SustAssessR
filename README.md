# SustAssessR
An integrated codebase for sustainability assessment using R

This codebase was used for and is made available alongside the following publication: 

Matthews, N. E., Cizauskas, C. A., Layton, D. S., Stamford, L., & Shapira, P. (2019). Collaborating constructively for sustainable biotechnology. Scientific Reports. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-54331-7

## A note on input data
This repository is designed to demonstrate and make available the code used for the above publication. Due to the proprietary nature of some of the process flow modelling the data in the directory "Data/ProcessedFlows" has been averaged and rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, while this codebase will authentically replicate the data processing carried out in the published analysis, the outputs will not be identical due to the changes made to the input data. All output data from the original publication has been made available through the supplementary information of the original publication.
